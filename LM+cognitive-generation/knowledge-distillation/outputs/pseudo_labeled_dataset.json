For example, plants use sunlight and water to grow, animals eat plants, and decomposers break down dead animals and plants.\n*   **Energy Flow:** Energy typically flows in one direction, from the sun to producers, then to consumers, and eventually dissipates as heat.\n*   **Nutrient Cycling:** Essential nutrients (like carbon, nitrogen, water) are constantly recycled within the ecosystem, moving between living organisms and the environment.\n*   **Scale:** Ecosystems can vary greatly in size, from a small pond or a rotting log to a vast forest, a desert, or an entire ocean.\n*   **Dynamic:** Ecosystems are not static; they are dynamic systems that are constantly changing and evolving due to internal processes and external disturbances.\n\nIn essence, an ecosystem is a self-sustaining unit where life processes, energy flow, and material cycling are integrated through a network of interactions."

In our expression, we have $2(x + 3)$, which means we multiply $2$ by each term inside the parentheses.\n\n*   Multiply $2$ by $x$: $2 \\times x = 2x$\n*   Multiply $2$ by $3$: $2 \\times 3 = 6$\n\nSo, $2(x + 3)$ becomes $2x + 6$.\nNow, substitute this back into the original expression:\n$2x + 6 + 4$\n\n**Step 2: Combine Like Terms.**\nLike terms are terms that have the same variable raised to the same power, or are constant terms (numbers without variables). In the expression $2x + 6 + 4$, we have:\n\n*   $2x$ (a term with the variable $x$)\n*   $6$ (a constant term)\n*   $4$ (a constant term)\n\nWe can combine the constant terms:\n$6 + 4 = 10$\n\nThe term $2x$ has no other like terms to combine with, so it remains $2x$.\n\nPutting it all together, we get:\n$2x + 10$\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe simplified expression is $\\boxed{2x + 10}$."
