    "conceptual_feedback": "Great job identifying the parts of a fraction in your second answer, Alice! When we compare fractions like 1/3 and 1/5, it's easy to think bigger numbers mean bigger pieces. However, the bottom number (the denominator) tells us how many *equal* pieces the whole is divided into. The more pieces you divide something into, the smaller each individual piece becomes.",
    "motivational_feedback": "You're showing good thinking, Alice, and it's completely normal to have these kinds of questions when learning fractions!",
    "example_explanation": "Let's use your cake idea! Imagine you have two identical cakes. If you cut one cake into 3 equal slices, and the other into 5 equal slices. Each slice from the cake cut into 3 pieces (like 1/3) will be a much bigger chunk than each slice from the cake cut into 5 pieces (like 1/5). So, 1/3 is actually larger.",
    "next_practice_recommendation": "For your next step, try drawing two identical rectangles. Divide one into 2 equal parts and shade 1 part (1/2). Divide the other into 4 equal parts and shade 1 part (1/4). Which shaded piece is larger?"

    "student_name": "Ben",
    "conceptual_feedback": "Ben, you did a great job figuring out the chocolate bar problem! That shows you really understand what fractions mean as parts of a whole. For adding fractions like 1/4 + 1/4, it's a common misunderstanding to add both the top (numerator) and bottom (denominator) numbers. However, when the bottom numbers (denominators) are already the same, you only add the top numbers (numerators) together, and the bottom number stays the same. The denominator tells you what 'kind' of pieces you have, and that 'kind' doesn't change when you add more of them.",
    "motivational_feedback": "Excellent work on the chocolate bar question, Ben! You clearly grasp the idea of fractions representing parts of a whole, which is a fantastic foundation. Keep up that good thinking!",
    "example_explanation": "Think about it like this: if you have 1 apple and add 1 more apple, you have 2 apples. You don't suddenly have '2 apple-apples'. The 'apple' part stays the same. Similarly, with 1/4 + 1/4, you have 1 'quarter' + 1 'quarter', which gives you 2 'quarters'. The 'quarter' (which is the /4) doesn't change. So, 1/4 + 1/4 equals 2/4 (which can be simplified to 1/2).",
    "next_practice_recommendation": "Let's try a couple more problems focusing on keeping the denominator the same when adding: \n1. What is 2/7 + 3/7?\n2. If you have 3/5 of a pie and someone gives you 1/5 more of the same pie, how much pie do you have altogether?"

  {
    "student_name": "Carla",
    "conceptual_feedback": "Carla, your method for finding equivalent fractions is spot on! You skillfully used the principle of multiplying (or dividing) both the numerator and denominator by the same number to create an equivalent fraction without changing its value. This is a very effective strategy for both simplifying fractions (like with 4/6) and expanding them to a common denominator (like with 3/5), making comparisons clear and accurate.",
    "motivational_feedback": "Excellent work, Carla! You're clearly demonstrating a strong and flexible understanding of fractions.",
    "example_explanation": "Your strategy of simplifying 4/6 to 2/3 first, and then expanding to 6/9, is a perfect illustration of how to tackle problems where the direct conversion isn't obvious. You essentially used two 'forms of 1' (dividing by 2/2 and then multiplying by 3/3) to reach the target denominator, showing great strategic thinking.",
    "next_practice_recommendation": "To reinforce your excellent grasp of these concepts, try finding an equivalent fraction for 10/15 that has a denominator of 12. This will give you another chance to apply your smart two-step simplification and expansion process."

  {
    "student_name": "David",
    "conceptual_feedback": "David, you did a great job converting the mixed number! For dividing fractions, it's a common misconception to multiply straight across. Instead, the rule for dividing fractions is to 'invert' (flip) the second fraction and then 'multiply'. This is because dividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal.",
    "motivational_feedback": "Excellent work on the mixed number conversion, David! You've got a strong foundation, and with a little focus, we'll master fraction division too.",
    "example_explanation": "Let's re-examine 2/3 ÷ 1/4. We keep the first fraction (2/3), invert the second fraction (1/4 becomes 4/1), and then multiply: (2/3) × (4/1) = 8/3. A simple way to think about division: if you have 2 whole pizzas and want to know how many 1/2-pizza servings you can make, you wouldn't multiply 2 × 1/2 and get 1 serving. You'd multiply 2 × 2 (the reciprocal of 1/2) to get 4 servings.",
    "next_practice_recommendation": "To reinforce this, try calculating 3/4 ÷ 1/2. Remember to clearly identify the second fraction, invert it, and then multiply. You could also try drawing a simple model to visualize what dividing a fraction means."

  {
    "student_name": "Emily",
    "conceptual_feedback": "Emily, your explanations demonstrate a sophisticated understanding of how fraction operations truly work! You've correctly identified that multiplying by a fraction less than one scales down the original number, and dividing by a fraction less than one scales it up. This shows you've moved beyond the common misconception and deeply understand the *effect* of these operations, not just the procedural steps.",
    "motivational_feedback": "Fantastic job, Emily! Your reasoning is incredibly clear and precise. You're thinking like a true mathematician, dissecting the 'why' behind the 'how'.",
    "example_explanation": "Your examples were perfect! To reinforce your thinking, consider this: when you multiply 10 by 1/2, you're finding 'half of 10,' which is indeed 5. It's like finding a percentage of a number, where a percentage less than 100% (or a fraction less than 1) will always give you a smaller result. For division, dividing 1.5 cups by 1/4 cup is like asking 'how many quarter-cup servings can I get from 1.5 cups?' You're essentially fitting smaller units into a larger total, so it makes sense to get a larger count of those smaller units.",
    "next_practice_recommendation": "Since you've mastered these foundational concepts so well, try applying your understanding to multi-step word problems involving fractions, especially those that might involve finding a fraction of a fraction (e.g., 'If 3/4 of a class are boys, and 1/3 of the boys wear glasses, what fraction of the class are boys who wear glasses?'). This will further solidify your insight into the scaling effect of fraction multiplication."
