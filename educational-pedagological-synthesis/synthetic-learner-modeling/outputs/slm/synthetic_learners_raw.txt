        "reasoning": "I need to divide 1 and 1/2 by 1/4. First, convert 1 and 1/2 to an improper fraction, which is 3/2. Then, 3/2 divided by 1/4 becomes 3/2 multiplied by 4/1. That's 12/2, which simplifies to 6. This makes sense because dividing by a small fraction should give a larger number of batches.",

While her initial misconception (from the planning stage) didn't manifest directly as an error in these responses, she could benefit from exploring more abstract or counter-intuitive fraction scenarios to deepen her understanding of number relationships beyond procedural mastery."
